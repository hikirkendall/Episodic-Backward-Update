# Episodic-Backward-Update
Implementation of ["Sample-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning via Episodic Backward Update"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12375), NeurIPS 2019.

EBU with a constant diffusion factor for the ATARI environment will be uploaded.

Our implementation is based on Shibi He's [implementation](https://github.com/ShibiHe/Q-Optimality-Tightening) of [Optimality Tightening](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01606) which is based on Nathan Sprague's implementation of [deep Q RL](https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl).

Please refer to [https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl](https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl) for installing the dependencies.
